Current weather data with City search and Map. The app takes advantage of the functionalities of OpenWeather API for gathering weather data and OpenStreetMap plus Leaflet for visualizing the map on a specific location.

The API prioritise US cities, so I've included the country code, which is optional.

For instance, **"Birmingham"** will show the weather in **Birmingham US**, while **Birmingham + uk** Will show the weather in **Birmingham GB**.

**Note:** If you clone the repository, the app won't work since the API key is missing.

## How the app looks like
